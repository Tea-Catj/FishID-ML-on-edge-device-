# FishID-ML-on-edge-device
this is for VGU project class
by  Trà Đăng Khoa – 17637, Nguyễn Hữu Minh Quang – 17452 

The model is trained on pre-trained model provided by Ultralytics since our dataset is small. Gather dataset and training Ml is a main reposibilitity of Nguyễn Hữu Minh Quang – 17452. While augmentation, labeling images and deploying is done by Trà Đăng Khoa – 17637.

This model is created for detecting various species of fish on edge devices. For now we focus on pet fish since they are easier to gather datatsets. We used YOLOv10 nano for dectection and various image augmentation techniques for better detection. We used google colab to help training the ML. 

There are 6 types of fish species that will be detected by this Ml:
- Cá Tứ Vân (Tiger barb fish)
- Cá buồm đỏ (red Sailfishe)
- cá neon (Neon tetra fish)
- cá lau kiếng cam (orange janitor fish)
- cá sặc (gourami fish)
