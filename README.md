This Machine learning is created for detecting vary species of fish on edge devices. For now we focus on pet fish since they are easier to gather datatsets. We used YOLOv10 nano for dectection and various image augmentation techniques for better detection.

There are 6 types of fish species that will be detected by this Ml:
- Cá Tứ Vân (Tiger barb fish)
- Cá buồm đỏ (red Sailfishe)
- cá neon (Neon tetra fish)
- cá lau kiếng cam (orange janitor fish)
- cá sặc (gourami fish)
